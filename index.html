            <p>The term “portfolio” refers to any combination of financial assets such as stocks, bonds and cash.
                Portfolios
                may be held by individual investors or managed by financial professionals, hedge funds, banks and other
                financial institutions. It is a generally accepted principle that a portfolio is designed according to
                the
                investor's risk tolerance, time frame and investment objectives. The monetary value of each asset may
                influence the risk/reward ratio of the portfolio.</p>
